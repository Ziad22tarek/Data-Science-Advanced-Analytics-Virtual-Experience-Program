 <p>At Feature Engineering stage i created some features and dummies and handling the outliers to get a better result at modeling stage</p>
 <p> At the modeling stage i built a model using Rondomforest and i got 92% of Accuracy Score but 8% of recall Score, So i uesd oversambling technique and i tuned the hyperparameters and i got 96% of Accuracy Score and 94% of recall Score </p>
